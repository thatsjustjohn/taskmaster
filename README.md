# Taskmaster

Taskmaster is a RESTFUL Api that allows you to add / edit / delete tasks for users to do.

Currently setting up paths and creating tables for stored of data.

Taskmaster:
Uses DynamoDB for storage data.
Adds new tasks to the list.
Sends an email to an administrator when a task is completed
Sends a text to the person to whom a task is assigned (when it gets assigned)
When a task is deleted from Dynamo, trigger a message that will fire a lambda to remove any images associated to it from S3
It uploads files to S3, and there is a Lambda function that resizes images to over 350K to 50x50, so both image urls full size and resized will be saved into dynamoDB and available for display on the frontend
